# MeshADV Mini LoRa HAT and Meshtastic Setup Scripts

This project contains a collection of scripts designed to streamline the setup and configuration of the Waveshare LoRaWAN/GNSS HAT and Meshtastic on Raspberry Pi devices.

## Features
- Automated setup for the Waveshare LoRaWAN/GNSS HAT with SPI and I2C configuration.
- Easy installation and update of Meshtastic CLI and Meshtasticd service.
- Backup and restore of Meshtastic configurations.
- Support for multiple architectures: `amd64`, `arm64`, `armhf`.
- Example configuration file for customizing your setup.
- `ncmesh_connect.sh` to easily set up and configure Meshtastic devices for the NC Mesh network.

## Requirements
### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi (any model supported by Meshtastic and MeshADV Mini LoRa HAT).
- MeshADV Mini LoRa/GNSS HAT ([Product Page]([https://github.com/chrismyers2000/MeshAdv-Mini](https://github.com/chrismyers2000/MeshAdv-Mini))).

### Software
- Raspberry Pi OS or another Debian-based Linux distribution.
- `bash` shell for running scripts.

## Setup Instructions

### Raspberry Pi LoRa HAT Configuration
To configure the LoRa HAT, run the following one-liner command:
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikro6/meshtastic_scripts/refs/heads/main/lora_hat_setup.sh -o /tmp/lora_hat_setup.sh; sudo bash /tmp/lora_hat_setup.sh; rm /tmp/lora_hat_setup.sh
```
- This script will enable SPI and I2C, configure the necessary device overlays, and ensure your Raspberry Pi is ready for the LoRaWAN/GNSS HAT.
- The script will prompt for a reboot to apply changes.

---

### Meshtastic Setup
To install or update Meshtastic CLI and Meshtasticd, run the following command:
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikro6/meshtastic_scripts/refs/heads/main/meshtastic_setup.sh -o /tmp/meshtastic_setup.sh; sudo bash /tmp/meshtastic_setup.sh; rm /tmp/meshtastic_setup.sh
```
- The script will:
  - Check and install required dependencies.
  - Set up a Python virtual environment for the Meshtastic CLI.
  - Install or update the `meshtasticd` service.
  - Back up existing Meshtastic configurations.
  - Start and optionally enable the Meshtasticd service.

## Example Configuration
This is an example configuration file for the MeshADV Mini LoRaWAN/GNSS HAT that I am using on my Pi.

1. Download the example configuration:
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikro6/meshtastic_scripts/refs/heads/main/example_config/config.yaml | sudo tee /etc/meshtasticd/config.yaml > /dev/null
   ```

2. Edit the file to suit your setup:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/meshtasticd/config.yaml
   ```

3. Restart the Meshtasticd service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart meshtasticd
   ```

NOTE: To check on what the service is doing, you can verify with this command to follow the service output:
```bash
journalctl -u meshtasticd -b
```
